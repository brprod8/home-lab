# Overview

DON (Device Operations Network) is a Python + Flask based Network Operations Platform built for a personal homelab.

Unlike traditional dashboards that only display devices, DON actively discovers devices, determines what they support, and exposes live actions that can interact with them.

Everything runs completely inside the local network.

No cloud.

No external APIs.

Only a Windows PC running DON and devices connected to the same Google WiFi network.

# Architecture

```
                Internet
                    │
             Google WiFi Router
                    │
      ┌─────────────┼──────────────┐
      │             │              │
 Windows PC      Roku TV        iPhone
   (DON)                          Browser
```

The Windows PC hosts the DON web server.

The iPhone connects through Safari and becomes a wireless control panel.

</p>

Communication uses Roku's External Control Protocol (ECP).

```
HTTP POST

http://ROKU_IP:8060/keypress/Home
http://ROKU_IP:8060/keypress/Back
http://ROKU_IP:8060/keypress/Up
http://ROKU_IP:8060/keypress/VolumeUp
```

---

## Desktop Control

Execute Python scripts remotely from your phone.

Features

- Desktop Health
- CPU Usage
- RAM Usage
- Disk Usage
- Execute Saved Scripts
- Live Python Editor
- Remote Script Execution

<p align="center">

</p>

Example

```python
print("Hello from my iPhone")

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

The script is transmitted over WiFi to the Windows PC where DON executes it and immediately streams the output back to the browser.

---

# Action Probe Engine

One of DON's biggest features is automatically determining what actions each discovered device supports.

Instead of only listing devices, DON asks:

> "What can I do with this device?"

Example

| Device | Port | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| Roku | 8060 | Remote Control |
| Windows PC | 445 | Desktop Control |
| Printer | 80 | Web Interface |
| Camera | 554 | RTSP Stream |
| NAS | 445 | File Management |

The dashboard automatically creates buttons for compatible actions.
